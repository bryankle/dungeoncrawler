- [x] **Set up Vite Build System**
  - [x] Remove Webpack and related dependencies (`webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`, `babel-loader`, `url-loader`, `file-loader`)
  - [x] Remove Babel-specific dependencies (`babel-core`, `babel-preset-es2015`, `babel-preset-react`, `babel-preset-stage-1`)
  - [x] Add Vite and Vite React plugin (`vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`)
  - [x] Create `vite.config.js` with basic React plugin configuration
- [x] **Update Core Libraries (Minimally)**
  - [x] Update React to v17 (`react`, `react-dom`)
  - [x] Update React-Redux to v7 (`react-redux`)
  - [x] (Optional) Update Redux to v4 (`redux`)
- [x] **Adjust Project Structure for Vite**
  - [x] Ensure `index.html` is at the project root
  - [x] Update script tag in `index.html` to `<script type="module" src="/src/index.js"></script>`
  - [x] Correct `base` path in `vite.config.js` for GitHub Pages
- [x] **Address Critical Code Issues for React 17 & Runtime**
  - [x] Rename `componentWillMount()` to `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()` in `src/containers/grid.js` (and any other components using it)
  - [x] Fix JSX parsing errors in Vite/esbuild
  - [x] Resolve "Maximum call stack size exceeded" in `_calculatePath`
  - [x] Fix character walking through walls (collision detection)
  - [x] Review and address any other immediate warnings/errors from React 17 (Marked as complete as app runs locally)
- [x] **Update `package.json` Scripts**
  - [x] Change `start` script to `dev`
  - [x] Add `build` script: `vite build`
  - [x] Add `deploy` script for `gh-pages`
  - [x] Update `test` script to be a placeholder
- [x] **Dependency Management**
  - [x] Remove `react-addons-test-utils`
  - [x] Add `gh-pages` to devDependencies
- [ ] **Testing and Iteration**
  - [ ] Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (This is crucial due to `react-router@2.x` needing React <16, while project uses React 17. This command installs dependencies ignoring this peer conflict for now.)
  - [x] Run `npm run dev` and open in browser (Achieved)
  - [x] Debug JSX errors (Achieved)
  - [x] Debug runtime errors (e.g., recursion, collisions) (Achieved)
  - [x] Fix CSS spacing issues for grid cells (Achieved)
- [ ] **Deployment to GitHub Pages**
  - [ ] Ensure `base` path in `vite.config.js` is correctly set to `/dungeoncrawler/` (or your specific repo name format).
  - [ ] Commit all changes to `vite.config.js` and `package.json`.
  - [ ] Run `npm run build` locally to ensure it completes without errors.
  - [ ] Run `npm run deploy` (which executes `gh-pages -d dist`).
  - [ ] In GitHub repository settings (Settings > Pages), configure the source to be "Deploy from a branch", and select the `gh-pages` branch with `/ (root)` folder.
  - [ ] Test the live site on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] **Post-Deployment Considerations (Future Work)**
  - [ ] Properly refactor `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` to `componentDidMount` or `constructor`
  - [ ] Upgrade React Router from v2 to a React 17+ compatible version (e.g., `react-router-dom@5` or `@6`) - This will resolve the need for `--legacy-peer-deps`.
  - [ ] Consider further React upgrades (e.g., to v18 and `createRoot`)
  - [ ] Evaluate state management (Redux) for more modern patterns (e.g., Redux Toolkit)
  - [ ] Improve testing setup (current tests are likely broken due to Babel/Webpack removal)
